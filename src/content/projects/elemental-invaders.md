## Overview
**Elemental Invaders** is a 3D arcade shoot ’em up inspired by **Space Invaders**, developed in **Unreal Engine** as part of a university group project. This was my first time designing and developing a game in a **team setting**, so the project was both a technical challenge and a valuable lesson in collaboration.

The twist is an **element counter system**. Each invader has an element (**Water, Air, Earth, Fire**) and the player must switch their own element to counter enemies effectively.

## Core Twist: Element Counter Gameplay
Each projectile has an element, and damage depends on the relationship between the projectile element and the invader element:

- **Counter element** → **double damage**
- **Neutral element** → **standard damage**
- **Weak element** → **half damage**

This encourages the player to actively switch element rather than using a single strategy for every wave. The system also adds a layer of decision-making: switching at the right time makes fights faster and safer, while switching at the wrong time wastes shots and increases risk.

---

## Iteration Through Feedback
We gathered feedback during development and revised the game multiple times based on what players struggled with.

### Improving Clarity
To make counter relationships easier to understand, we:
- **highlighted invaders** in a **yellow box** to clearly show which enemies were being countered

### Improving Readability
Some players struggled to see important elements like projectiles and occasional power-ups, so we:
- scaled up key visuals and gameplay elements to improve visibility and readability

These changes made the game feel more accessible and reduced confusion, especially for first-time players.

## My Contributions
Although my role was **Artist / Gameplay Designer**, I contributed heavily across both visuals and systems.

### Visuals / Design
- Designed the different invader visuals
- Implemented the **highlighting** system in-engine
- Matched implementation closely to **concept art** created by a teammate

### Backend / Gameplay Systems
I also created and implemented several key systems:
- Projectile behaviour
- The element system (switching + element logic)
- Camera setup
- Player movement and controls

### Team Support
I was the most experienced with Unreal Engine on the team, so I also:
- supported teammates with implementation and problem-solving
- helped unblock issues across different parts of development when needed

## Collaboration & Version Control
This was my first time using version control **collaboratively** with multiple people on the same project. While it wasn’t my first experience with version control in general, it was my first time working with it as part of a team workflow.

It helped me learn how to:
- coordinate changes across multiple contributors
- avoid conflicts through clear communication and planning
- keep features organised and track progress as the project evolved


---

## What I Learned
This project taught me a lot about the realities of collaborative development:

- Working in a team can sometimes be frustrating, especially when coordinating ideas and merging work
- Clear communication and support are critical to keep progress moving
- Iteration based on feedback can significantly improve player understanding
- The final output is often **worth the struggle**, and the experience improved my confidence in team-based game development
